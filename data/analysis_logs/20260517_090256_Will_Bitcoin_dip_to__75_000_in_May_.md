### Reasoning
Statistical signal shows markets priced at 58% YES historically resolve YES only 44.7% of the time (n=13,967) — clear crowd overpricing. BTC at $78,055 needs only ~3.9% drop to hit $75K, but no specific bearish catalyst exists. Goldman Sachs suggests crypto may be nearing a bottom (contrarian bullish). Fear sentiment at 27 is driving narrative pessimism without concrete breaking news. Pattern data shows crypto-pattern WR is weak at 20% (n=5). Entry range 50-60% has strong historical WR (86%, n=7) for NO bets. Crowd is extrapolating Fear & Greed deterioration into probability overpricing — classic sentiment bias without fundamental catalyst.

## Gate Result
- **Passed:** ❌ NO
