## LLM Decision
- **Action:** SKIP
- **Confidence:** 65%
- **p_true:** 36.7%
- **Information Gap:** False
- **Crowd Bias:** False
- **Catalyst Type:** NONE
- **Catalyst Strength:** 0.10

### Reasoning
Market price (41%) nearly identical to bookmaker consensus (Padres implied 41.8-42.4%), gap vs base rate only 4% (below 5% threshold). Padres have 3 SPs on IL (Waldron, Marquez, Darvish), but this is already priced into bookmaker odds. Mariners also missing key players (Cal Raleigh C). No new information edge identified that isn't reflected in current pricing. Critical warning: historical pattern shows Entry 40-50% range has only 9% win rate from 11 trades - extremely poor performance zone. Prior two analyses of this exact market correctly resulted in SKIP. Recommend waiting for clearer catalyst or larger information asymmetry.

## Gate Result
- **Passed:** ❌ NO
- **Reason:** no stat edge gap=4%<5%
