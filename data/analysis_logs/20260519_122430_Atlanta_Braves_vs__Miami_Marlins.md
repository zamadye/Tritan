## LLM Decision
- **Action:** SKIP
- **Confidence:** 63%
- **p_true:** 52.4%
- **Information Gap:** True
- **Crowd Bias:** False
- **Catalyst Type:** STATISTICAL_PATTERN
- **Catalyst Strength:** 0.70

### Reasoning
Strong statistical signal (n=13,967) shows markets priced at 57% YES resolve YES only 44.7% of the time — a 12.3% systematic overpricing of YES. The 57% market price appears to be in a well-documented 'overpricing zone' for this market structure. Both teams have comparable injury situations (3 players on IL each), with no clear competitive advantage for Atlanta. No specific game-level catalyst was found to justify the elevated YES price. The crowd appears biased toward the favorite (Braves), inflating the price beyond fair value. The 44.7% historical resolution suggests fair value is closer to 45%, making NO at 43% an ~12% edge.

## Gate Result
- **Passed:** ❌ NO
- **Reason:** no stat edge gap=3%<5%
